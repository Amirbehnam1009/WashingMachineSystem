## About
The scheduling algorithm used is Preemptive Earliest Deadline First(EDF). This project was designed to get some basic ideas of how scheduling alogrithms are used in real world simulated systems.



## How to Run

1.  Run the Arduino file attached to the folder, as you run the file scroll down to the very bottom and copy the address path with the .Elf file ( it has .Elf at the end of it).
2.  Now open the Proteus project attached.
3.  Double click on the ATMEGA2560 board.
4.  Paste the address path copied in step one in the "PROGRAM FILE" section
